        <h3 className='aboutH3'>Nature</h3>
        <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural world, physical world, or material world. Nature refers to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic. The term nature may refer to living plants and animals, geological processes, weather, and physics, such as matter and energy. The term is often refers to the natural environment or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general areas that have not been substantially altered by humans, or which persist despite human intervention. For, example, manufactured objects and human interaction are generally not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, human nature or the whole of nature. This more traditional concept of nature implies a distinction between natural and artificial elements of the Earth, with the artificial as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.</p>
        <h3 className='aboutH3'>People</h3>
        <p>A people is a plurality of persons considered as a whole, as is the case with an ethnic group or nation. Collectively, for example, the contemporary Frisians and Danes are two related Germanic peoples, while various Middle Eastern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as Semitic peoples.</p>
        <h3 className='aboutH3'>Trips</h3>
        <p>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.[1][2] Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements.</p>
        <h3 className='aboutH3'>Animal</h3>
        <p>Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The study of animals is called zoology.</p>
        <h3 className='aboutH3'>Fashion</h3>
        <p>Fashion is a popular style, especially in clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle and body.[citation needed] Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which people present themselves. A fashion can become the prevailing style in behaviour or manifest the newest creations of designers, technologists, engineers, and design managers.[1][need quotation to verify] Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked[by whom?] to the term fashion, the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy-dress or masquerade wear, while the word fashion often refers to clothing, including the study of clothing. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.</p>
