        <p className='contactP'>Work on the album originally began in May 2000, while Eiffel 65 were on a tour bus in the United States. They had brought a laptop computer, a keyboard and a pair of speakers, and Back In Time would be the first track written for the album. When the group went back to Turin, they would take more time to get back in touch in producing music. The album was developed over the course of six months,[5] with 31 demos recorded. The album`s sound is very different from the group`s first album. Europop (1999), taking influence from French house Ã  la Daft Punk. It also incorporates synthpop elements. However, the harder and more metallic Eurodance sound of their earlier work occasionally shines through on some tracks. Member Jeffrey Jey called the change of sound from their previous album more of a development than a radical change in direction. New techniques of arrangement were also used, such as sampling sounds into instruments.</p>
